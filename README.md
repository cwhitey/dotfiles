These are my dotfiles (e.g. .emacs.d, .zshrc, etc.)
Use ````./push-to-local.sh```` to bootstrap the dotfiles to your local
machine. ````./update-repo-using-local.sh```` will do the exact oposite, but don't use it as you'll likely get a whole bunch of files you don't want in your repo, like those downloaded from melpa for emacs.
